Martin (Marty) Wilson Candidate for Bermuda Run Town Council

Why did you decide to seek public office?
My wife and I love living here in Bermuda Run and I would like to serve my community as a member of
the town council. My education and professional work experience is public management and I have
extensive experience working for local governments in North Carolina.
What do you think are the biggest challenges facing the town, and how do you intend to address
those challenges?
The biggest challenges facing the town are managing growth and providing reliable infrastructure.
Managing growth is obviously a big challenge. We live in a very desirable place and developers will be
anxious to develop any and all usable properties. The community, as a whole, does not want to add
large apartment complexes or other development that would increase traffic and negatively affect our
quality of life. It is not as simple as passing a ban on certain types of development because there are
legal, regulatory and fairness issues that must be considered. In order to manage growth so that our
quality of life is not diminished, the town council must be able to find solutions that will control growth
without depriving property owners and developers of their rights. My education and previous local
government experience will be beneficial in providing solutions for these complicated problems.
The other major challenge for our town is providing reliable infrastructure. The town is responsible for
the maintenance of some, but not all, of the streets within the city limits. A plan needs to be developed
and followed to resurface our streets in a timely manner, provide and maintain sidewalks and walkways
and keep our streets, sidewalks, and walking trails clean and safe. The town’s sewer system is the other
major infrastructure challenge. The town would like to give the sewer system to Davie County Utilities to
own, operate and maintain in the same manner as the water system. However, Davie County will not
take over ownership unless the system is in reasonable condition. Since parts of the existing sewer
system are 50 years old, rehabilitation and/or upgrades will be needed. The town has received a
$400,000 grant to identify and assess the condition of our sewer system. Upon completion of this work,
the town will need to develop a Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) that will address the deficiencies. My
previous experience in local government includes developing and implementing capital improvement
plans.
As our town grows, we will be faced with many challenges. The role of a town council member is to
listen to the citizens to determine what they want to achieve and then use their experience and
knowledge of local government rules, regulations, policies, and procedures, to address these challenges.
The goal is to provide outcomes that are legal, fair, and acceptable to all the parties involved. We need a
town council that has that experience and knowledge. I have over forty years of experience working in
and with local governments in North Carolina. Through App State and the UNC Institute of Government
Municipal Administration Course, I learned about the rules and regulations that both empower and
restrict local government’s authority. As an employee of the Town of Granite Falls, NC, I developed an
understanding of how government works in the real world. As a department head for the City of
Newton, NC, I experienced working with citizens, contractors, business owners, town staff, and town
councils. As a managerial specialist with NC Rural Water Association, I provided technical, financial, and

managerial assistance to local governments in North Carolina. I believe that my experience and
knowledge of local government has provided me the skills that are necessary to be an advocate for the
citizens of Bermuda Run as an effective member of the Bermuda Run Town Council.

Are you satisfied with the law enforcement contract and coverage with the Davie County Sherriff’s
Office?
Deputy John Hobson was assigned to be our new designated officer earlier this year. He addressed the
town council on July 8, 2025 and he is a very capable and informed deputy. I feel certain that our
contract with the Sherriff’s Department will continue to provide our town with excellent service. I
expect that Deputy Hobson will be very active in our community events and he will be responsive to
citizen request. There will be a need for increased diligence in enforcing traffic concerns (such as
speeding) as our town continues to grow and the council will need to continuously monitor our
coverage.
Other Issues
The NC State Legislature passed Senate Bill 25 in December of 2024. Portions of this bill severely restrict
how the town changes our zoning ordinances. Therefore, it will be challenging for our town to find ways
to control growth within the confines of the new rules. The council and the planning board are working
with consultants to identify how we can adjust our ordinances legally and address the concerns of our
citizens.
The town adopted the Town of Bermuda Run Comprehensive Plan on April 11, 2023. This plan was
developed with input from our citizens and it provides objectives and strategies for the council to follow
to achieve the vision and goals identified by the public participation. If elected I plan to follow the
implementation strategies as provided by the Comprehensive Plan.
Approximately 1100 property owners in our town live “behind the gates”. The town is examining ways
to manage the gate operations that will be fair to those both outside and inside the gates. Gate
operation fees are paid by those property owners behind the gates but presently the town is
administering the contracts. Other options for administration of the operations contract will be
determined by the council soon. I will support any plan that is fair and equitable for all our citizens.
The walkway project is moving forward although there are no visible signs of construction. This is due to
the preliminary work of design, utility relocation and right of way acquisition is being completed. I will
support this project and will work to provide information and updates regarding its progress.
I have extensive experience working with budgets for local governments. If elected, I pledge to be
diligent in monitoring our budget expenditures to insure that your tax dollars are being used effectively
and efficiently.
