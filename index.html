                            I am a five-year resident of the Town of Bermuda Run seeking to fill a position on the Town 
                            Council. <br><br>
                            I was born in western North Carolina (Granite Falls) and graduated from Appalachian State 
                            University. 
                            I worked for local governments including the City of Granite Falls, the City of Graham and the 
                            City of Newton, NC.
                            I retired from a 30-year career in local government in 2010 and worked with a non-profit agency that provided technical, managerial, and financial assistance to local governments from 2010 until 2020. 
                            <br><br>
                            I currently serve on the Town's Planning Board and I am a volunteer for the American Red Cross 
                            Disaster Assistance Team. 
                            I enjoy playing golf at BRCC with the Barnum Group on most Tuesdays and Thursdays.

                                        During my professional career in local government, 
                                        I worked with town councils, town employees, contractors, 
                                        local businesses, representatives from other local governments 
                                        and town citizens. This experience has provided me the opportunity 
                                        to understand how to effectively work with a variety of parties 
                                        to achieve positive outcomes. <br><br>

                                        I provided technical, managerial, and financial assistance to local 
                                        governments throughout North Carolina as an employee of a non-profit 
                                        organization (NC Rural Water Association) for 10 years after retiring 
                                        from public service. In this capacity I was responsible for assisting 
                                        local governments with issues such as staffing, budget development and 
                                        regulatory compliance. <br><br>

                                        I graduated from Appalachian State University with a B.S. degree in 
                                        Public Management. <br><br>

                                        I have completed the Municipal Administration Course, a comprehensive 
                                        course of instruction on all phases of local government. This course 
                                        was provided by the UNC Institute of Government.

                                        <strong>Managing Growth:</strong> We live in a very desirable place and developers will be 
                                        anxious to develop any and all usable properties. The community, as a whole, does not want 
                                        to add large apartment complexes or other development that would increase traffic and 
                                        negatively affect our quality of life. It is not as simple as passing a ban on certain types 
                                        of development because there are legal, regulatory and fairness issues that must be considered. 
                                        In order to manage growth so that our quality of life is not diminished, the town council must 
                                        be able to find solutions that will control growth without depriving property owners and 
                                        developers of their rights. <br><br>
                                        
                                        <strong>Reliable Infrastructure:</strong> The town is responsible for the maintenance of some, 
                                        but not all, of the streets within the city limits. A plan needs to be developed and followed 
                                        to resurface our streets in a timely manner, provide and maintain sidewalks and walkways and 
                                        keep our streets, sidewalks, and walking trails clean and safe. The town's sewer system is the 
                                        other major infrastructure challenge. The town would like to give the sewer system to Davie 
                                        County Utilities to own, operate and maintain in the same manner as the water system. However, 
                                        Davie County will not take over ownership unless the system is in reasonable condition. Since 
                                        parts of the existing sewer system are 50 years old, rehabilitation and/or upgrades will be needed. 
                                        The town has received a
                                        $400,000 grant to identify and assess the condition of our sewer system. Upon completion of this work,
                                        the town will need to develop a Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) that will address the deficiencies. My
                                        previous experience in local government includes developing and implementing capital improvement
                                        plans.

                                        My education and previous local government experience will be beneficial in providing solutions 
                                        for these complicated problems. As our town grows, we will be faced with many challenges. The role 
                                        of a town council member is to listen to the citizens to determine what they want to achieve and 
                                        then use their experience and knowledge of local government rules, regulations, policies, and 
                                        procedures, to address these challenges. <br><br>
                                        
                                        The goal is to provide outcomes that are legal, fair, and acceptable to all the parties involved. 
                                        We need a town council that has that experience and knowledge. I have over forty years of experience 
                                        working in and with local governments in North Carolina. Through App State and the UNC Institute of 
                                        Government Municipal Administration Course, I learned about the rules and regulations that both empower 
                                        and restrict local government's authority. <br><br>
                                        
                                        I believe that my experience and knowledge of local government has provided me the skills that are 
                                        necessary to be an advocate for the citizens of Bermuda Run as an effective member of the Bermuda Run 
                                        Town Council.

                                            Those who know me will tell you that I do more listening than speaking. 
                                            If I am elected to the position of council member for the Town of 
                                            Bermuda Run, I vow to listen to the concerns and preferences of the 
                                            citizens and use my knowledge and experience in local government to provide 
                                            leadership in shaping policies and procedures to achieve the outcomes that 
                                            the citizens desire.

                                        Deputy John Hobson was assigned to be our new designated officer earlier this year. 
                                        He addressed the town council on July 8, 2025 and he is a very capable and informed deputy. 
                                        I feel certain that our contract with the Sheriff's Department will continue to provide our 
                                        town with excellent service. I expect that Deputy Hobson will be very active in our community 
                                        events and he will be responsive to citizen requests. There will be a need for increased 
                                        diligence in enforcing traffic concerns (such as speeding) as our town continues to grow and 
                                        the council will need to continuously monitor our coverage.

                                        The NC State Legislature passed Senate Bill 25 in December of 2024. Portions of this bill 
                                        severely restrict how the town changes our zoning ordinances. Therefore, it will be challenging 
                                        for our town to find ways to control growth within the confines of the new rules. The council 
                                        and the planning board are working with consultants to identify how we can adjust our ordinances 
                                        legally and address the concerns of our citizens.

                                        The town adopted the Town of Bermuda Run Comprehensive Plan on April 11, 2023. This plan was 
                                        developed with input from our citizens and it provides objectives and strategies for the council

                                        Approximately 1100 property owners in our town live "behind the gates". The town is examining 
                                        ways to manage the gate operations that will be fair to those both outside and inside the gates. 
                                        Gate operation fees are paid by those property owners behind the gates but presently the town is 
                                        administering the contracts. Other options for administration of the operations contract will be 
                                        determined by the council soon. I will support any plan that is fair and equitable for all our citizens.

                                        diligent in monitoring our budget expenditures to ensure that your tax dollars are being used 
                                        effectively and efficiently.
